ESTree Explorer is a easy way to visually the [ESTree](https://github.com/estree/estree) specification without getting a headache.

The current problem with the [ESTree](https://github.com/estree/estree) specification is that it is hard to just easily find out what the spec looks like for a variable declaration unless you know that it was introduced in es5 and that is was changed in es2015 with "let" and "const" as different kinds.

ESTree explorer tries to make development with the AST easy by providing search and scraped links to MDN to easily get an example.
