ESTree Explorer is a easy way to visually the [ESTree](https://github.com/estree/estree) specification without getting a headache.

The current problem with the[ ESTree](https://github.com/estree/estree) specification is that it is hard to just easily find out what the spec looks like for a variable declaration unless you know that it was introduced in es5 but in es2015 "let" and "const" was added as different kinds.
